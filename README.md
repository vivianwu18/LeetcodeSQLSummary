# Leetcode SQL Summary
*Last updated: 07/20/2023*

## Introduction
After finishing all **Medium** level SQL questions, I would like to summarize all questions by topics for better reviews.
I plan to finish Easy and Hard level in the near future and will update them as well. I will also categorize all the questions by topics to make it easier to review and learn a specific topic.

I mainly focus on **MySQL/ MSSQL Server**.
